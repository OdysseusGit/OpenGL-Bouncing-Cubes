# OpenGL-Bouncing-Cubes
A needlessly complicated OpenGL animation of bouncing cubes.
Cubes are added to the world by pressing the space bar, and the camera is controlled by the W, A, S and D keys and mouse movements.
This project uses the GLFW OpenGL library, GLEW 2.1.0 and the mathematics library GLM.
